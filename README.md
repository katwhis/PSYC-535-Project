# PSYC 535 Project
This is a project I designed during PSYC 535 Programming for Psychologists that tested implicit associations of cats and dogs to positive and negative words. To see my data, please access the presentation file. To see my data analysis, please access the project analysis file. If you would like to perform this test yourself, please read the instructions below.

# To Run this Project
This test is ran using PsychoPy, so make sure you have this app downloaded. This test will first use a gui to gather information on a couple questions, and will then run four sections of trials where you will be asked to sort stimuli into categories. To run this, please download the .py file provided and the twelve images of cats and dogs. Open the .py file in PsychoPy, and make sure that these images are in the same folder as the .py file before you run the experiment. Nothing should need to be changed before running the code unless you would like to change the number of trials. To do this, access the for loop in each section and change the current argument to the range function to whichever number you prefer. Once finished with changes, make sure everything is saved and then hit the green button in psychopy. There is no particular order of files and the experiment should continue by itself.
